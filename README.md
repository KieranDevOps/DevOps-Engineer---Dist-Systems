# DevOps Engineer – On-Prem/Private Cloud – Distributed Systems – London– up to £75,000 

# Stack: 
Linux (Debian), KVM, Icinga, KariosDB, Cassandra, PostgresSQL, Ceph. Distributed systems managing large IoT networks. Highly secure environment – ISO9001,14001,27001. Highly available, highly automated. 

# The company: 
A payments and monitoring company in the energy market. They build their own embedded devices and design some awesome software alongside. Their mission is to leverage technology to reduce the damage caused by the energy giants and big corporates.

# The culture: 
The culture is very Google-esc… unsurprising when you consider the CTO is ex-Google. Naturally the engineering standard is high and a there is firm focus on innovation. Engineers are empowered to make key decisions and contribute to the technology roadmap at every junction. 

# The role: 
Working closely with the CTO, you will help design, build and develop a world class, highly complex architecture capable of handling sensitive data in real time, across multiple geographic regions. The teams is responsible for creating a modern, maintainable and automated environment for their software and support services to thrive.
# Project examples: 
Keeping a complex technical architecture simple – how on earth right? With a simple vision. Main aims over the next year are to create an infrastructure that is 100% automated (all open source FYI) and to create a dev environment that uses common Build chain across software, testing and monitoring – repeatable, auditable, IaC.

# What experience is required?
* Engineering skills. By this I mean true deep troubleshooting and design skills. Someone who sees a business problem and their immediate response is “I can fix that permanently with a tech solution”. Someone that had lots of administration experience but not engineering will likely struggle in this team. 
* You will need to have experience with a large portion on the stack mentioned above. The CTO is happy to train up good engineers but the base skills must be there. 
* Strong experience and a passion for Automating everything. 
* Experience managing complex software stacks
* Deep knowledge of CI/CD tooling and pipelines. 
* knowledge of how to build scalable systems outside of public cloud solutions.
